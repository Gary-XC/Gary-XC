## Projects
### [PATH 411 – Applied Data Science in Molecular Medicine](https://github.com/Gary-XC/Path-411)
Queens Course where I completed assignmetns for PATH 411: Applied Data Science in Molecular Medicine, a hands-on course focused on applying statistics and machine learning to high-dimensional genomic datasets

Tools: Python, MATLAB, SPSS, high-performance computing (HPC) cluster enviroment (Fronteac Center for Advanced Computing)

- Completed a full end-to-end machine learning workflow on high-dimensional genomic datasets, progressing from raw data preprocessing to validated predictive modeling and survival analysis.
- Designed reproducible data pipelines for normalization, feature filtering, and outlier detection across thousands of features.
- Applied dimensionality reduction, feature selection, and multi-model benchmarking (Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Ensembles) with cross-validation and ROC-based evaluation.
- Integrated statistical inference and survival modeling to connect predictive outputs with real-world outcome interpretation.
- Built HPC-based RNA-seq alignment and quantification pipeline, demonstrating large-scale data engineering and automation capabilities.

### [Market Share Interactive Dashboard](https://marketshare-dashboard.streamlit.app/)
Market share and revenue data for the largest companies in the S&P 500 using financial statement APIs. 

Tools: Python, Streamlit, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, Numpy

Features:
- Led the development of an automated data pipeline to extract market share and revenue metrics for top S&P 500 companies using APIs like yFinance and Alpha Vantage
- Designed and managed scripts to retrieve, clean, and standardize multi-year financial data for historical and comparative analysis.
- Compiled the data into structured formats for visualization and further analytics
